Title: Dynamic Friend Request System with Like Button

Description:

The "Dynamic Friend Request System with Like Button" is a mini-project showcasing a simple interactive web feature using HTML and JavaScript. This project demonstrates the functionality of a friend request system and a like button, both of which can dynamically change their states and appearance based on user interactions.

Key Features:

Friend Request System:

The project includes a "friend request" button (btn) and a heading (heading5) to display the friendship status.
Initially, when the page loads, the button is labeled "add request," indicating that you can send a friend request.
When the button is clicked for the first time, the heading changes to "you are friends," and the button text changes to "remove friend," simulating a friend request being accepted.
Clicking the button again changes the status back to "add friend request," and the button text reverts to "add request."
Like Button:

The project also includes a "like" button (like) that allows users to like an item or content on the webpage.
Initially, the like button is unliked (white color).
When the like button is clicked, it changes color to red, indicating that the item has been liked.
Clicking the liked button again changes the color back to white, signifying that the like has been removed.
Usage Instructions:

Open the web page containing the friend request system and like button.
Click the "add request" button to simulate sending a friend request, and observe the change in status and button text.
Click the "remove friend" button to simulate removing the friend or cancelling the request, and observe the change in status and button text.
Click the "like" button to like an item or content, and observe the change in button color to red.
Click the liked "like" button again to remove the like and change the button color back to white.



* This mini-project serves as a simple but instructive example of how interactivity can be implemented on a web page using JavaScript. It can be a useful starting point for those 
  learning to work with event handling and dynamic webpage elements.
